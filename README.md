## Weather
Weather App is my first introduction app using the react-native framework. I am 75% finished! Great experience so far.

## Config File
For a simple solution to storing api keys. I created a js file to store these kind of data. It is ignored in this repo so dont forget to create onea and add the necessary variables.

## To Do
* Fetch calls to Weather API
* AsyncStorage of the payload from the API
* PullDown gesture to check if data is updated
