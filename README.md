## Weather
Weather App is my first introduction app using the react-native framework.

This project is not finished and still lacks a several features like fetching live weather data.

## To Do
* Correctly output the date + time of each weather box
* Create rows that represent a day of the week
* A row will be a slider where a user can swipe left or right to see the weather per 3 hours of the day
* Be able to fetch and update the weather data via pulling down on the screen by the user
