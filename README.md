## Weather
Weather App is my first introduction app using the react-native framework. I am 75% finished! Great experience so far.

## Config File
For a simple solution to storing api keys. I created a js file to store these kind of data. It is ignored in this repo so dont forget to create onea and add the necessary variables.

## To Do
* Fix the order of the days displayed
* Find a solution to refresh data on pulldown gesture. Currently, we have a button to invoke a refresh in data.

## How to run it locally
* TBD
